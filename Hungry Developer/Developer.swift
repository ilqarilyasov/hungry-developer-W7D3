// Create 5 spoons & 5 developers giving each developer a left and right spoon
// Developers will of course share spoons
// Ever developer's right spoon is the next developer's left spoon
// Call run() on each developer in a different queue/thread
// You can do this with following code assuming you put your developers in an array

//DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform(iterations: 5) {
//    developers[$0].run()
//}

// think until left spoon is available. When it is, pick it up
// think until right spoon is available. When it is, pick it up
// when both spoons are held, eat for a fixed amount of time
// then put the right spoon down
// then put the left spoon down
// repeat from the beginning
